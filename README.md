This is a test project for the SHIFT practice (Summer-Fall 2025)

July 18, 2025

It is not very clever and smart, but what is done here:

- parsed the data received from randomuser.me* and sorted alphabetically by last name
- when clicking the contact you see the card with more detailed info
- clicking on the phone or email takes you to corresponding soft (dialer and email client)
- when you re-enter the app all the contacts remain on their place.


* with a small detail that it was copy-pasted and saved to Resources, as I got out of time trying to integrate with OKHTTP. Ooops.
